# Master Flutter State N Arch

I am teaching the Transparent Functional Reactive Programming State Management strategy. At its core is using functional side effects to compute state and state graphs as a better way to manage Flutter app state.

Provider, Riverpod, Streams, Value Notifier, and BLoC go well with this pattern. In fact the framework I use plays nice with them.

I want to thank my Flutter Brazil App designing friends for authoring the packages through the Flutterando group.
